# Challenge 1
Write a program that asks the user for 3 numbers. Return the product of these 3 numbers multiplied together. If the user puts in less than 3 numbers, return 0; If the user puts in more than 3 numbers, only multiply the first 3. If the number is not a number, default that value to 1.

# Challenge 2



I prompt the user and ask them to enter a number between 2 and 10. 
I read that information and run a try parse in order to test my conversion.
If everything runs smoothly, it prompts the user that number of times.
After the user has entered the numbers, it takes the sum and provides the average.

Create a method that will output to the console the following design. Pay attention to spacing.


Tests:

No tests are required



The first for loop is calculating the spaces while the second one is incrementing
The same follows suit to print the bottom half

# Challenge 5

I declare an int to hold my array and put some variable in to mitigate workload.
I prompt the user to enter the amount of numbers they want in array.
